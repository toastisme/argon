### Argon ###

Argon is a real-time MD toy allowing the user to play with both the pairwise and external potentials in a simulation of point particles. Beta release is set for 22/07/16.

The Argon team consists of David McDonagh, Robert Shaw, and Staszek Welsh.

### Building ###

Argon is built on [openFrameworks](http://openframeworks.cc/), and should be pulled into the main directory of an openFrameworks project to correctly set up the dependencies.
