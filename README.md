### Argon ###

Argon is a real-time MD toy allowing the user to play with both the pairwise and external potentials in a simulation of point particles. Beta release was 22/07/16.

The Argon team consists of David McDonagh, Robert Shaw, and Staszek Welsh.

### Building ###

Argon is built on [openFrameworks](http://openframeworks.cc/), and this repository should be cloned into the main directory of an openFrameworks project to correctly set up the dependencies. Currently, Argon only supports OSX.

#### Build instructions for OSX ####

1. Download the latest version of [openFrameworks](http://openframeworks.cc/download) for OSX.
2. Extract the .zip file to a directory, and navigate to that directory in a terminal window.
3. openFrameworks applications are, by default, located within the 'myApps' folder, which can be found by executing
    ```
    cd apps/myApps
    ```.
4. Make a local clone of the Argon repository by executing
    ```
    git clone https://bitbucket.org/stargonauts/argon
    ```.
5. Navigate into the directory you have just created:
    ```
    cd argon
    ```.
6. Build Argon using the command
    ```
    make Release
    ```.
This will take some time as openFrameworks is distributed as source code, and so needs to be compiled in full.
7. Run Argon by opening the application with
    ```
    open bin/argon.app
    ```
, or alternatively using the command
    ```
    make RunRelease
    ```.
